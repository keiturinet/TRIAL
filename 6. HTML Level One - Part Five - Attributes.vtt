Hello everyone and welcome to part five attributes in this lecture we talking about.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.300
Tim attributes would allow us to actually add more information to NHT melted.

00:16.510 --> 00:22.080
And this includes things such as adding a link to another web page or referencing an image.

00:22.090 --> 00:27.190
Let's get started all of this by jumping to the Adam text editor in our browser.

00:27.190 --> 00:32.910
OK here I am back at the Adam text editor and I'm still using the basic study T.M. file.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.750
You can you sort of reached him if you want.

00:34.780 --> 00:40.350
You can also use the part 5 h HTML attributes file that comes with the actual course notes.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.370
Is going to be editing basic studies Timo.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.030
Now we're going to need a few things.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.410
One thing we'll need is an actual image file.

00:47.470 --> 00:53.380
When we talk about setting an image inside of our page HTML file and to do that we should do is either

00:53.380 --> 01:00.520
find on your computer or download or just use the PMG provided for you in the notes a drop DNG file

01:00.630 --> 01:03.580
and make sure you save it in the same directory at the.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.160
Himself all you're working with isn't.

01:05.230 --> 01:10.390
So you can see here I have this basic study to metafile that I'm playing around with in the exact same

01:10.390 --> 01:11.110
directory.

01:11.170 --> 01:15.020
I have this PMG picture here this image file.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.850
So let me now close that and show you how we can actually insert an image into our h tim L and the way

01:21.850 --> 01:23.610
we do that is if an image tag.

01:23.690 --> 01:25.600
And that's going to be I m g.

01:25.690 --> 01:31.840
So I'm just going to click enter here and you'll notice you get an automatic pop up that says S R C

01:32.110 --> 01:35.660
and A L T and that stands for source and ultimate.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.810
And we're going to explain those in just a little bit.

01:37.810 --> 01:45.040
First thing is to notice that this is actually a self-closing tag meaning everything here goes into

01:45.040 --> 01:46.400
this one image tag.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.690
You don't see as we've seen before in the past.

01:48.730 --> 01:55.510
This closing tag it just comes in one self-contained tags that's called a self-closing tag and we can

01:55.510 --> 01:58.230
actually use this to source an image.

01:58.240 --> 02:06.090
So the thing I'll type here and SIRC for the source of the image is just Django the P and G and then

02:06.120 --> 02:12.270
I'm going to do control s save and then refresh this page and you'll notice I actually get this image

02:12.270 --> 02:12.820
right here.

02:12.840 --> 02:18.780
And later on we'll learn about resizing images or squeezing them or stretching them however we want.

02:18.780 --> 02:23.290
Right now we're just using the default image size so you can see here I said image tag.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.940
Check out the source jingle that PAGG and then an alternate.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.290
We're about to discuss.

02:28.380 --> 02:35.190
Something to note here is that if this file is not in the exact same directory as this H-2 hymnal file

02:35.400 --> 02:41.220
you may need to put in the entire file path but we'll discuss that much later on we're talking about

02:41.220 --> 02:47.010
Django when we actually want to link to a specific folder that has all our images and all our documents

02:47.010 --> 02:47.640
in it.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.250
Right now I'll keep things simple by keeping the actual image file in the same directory as they watched

02:53.250 --> 02:54.780
him file.

02:54.780 --> 02:57.630
Let's discuss this a LTE or alternate.

02:57.630 --> 03:04.050
Basically what this is for is an alternate thing to display in case you can't find the PMG file.

03:04.050 --> 03:09.090
So for example let's say I type in missing that P and G.

03:09.090 --> 03:13.860
Now if you look at my directory here I only have Gengel that PNB I don't have some picture called missing

03:13.860 --> 03:14.740
that pinchy.

03:14.970 --> 03:21.570
Which means I'll actually have a broken link so if I refresh this we see that classic broken link picture

03:21.670 --> 03:27.630
that basically says hey I couldn't find this missing PAGG which means it's always a good idea to have

03:27.630 --> 03:35.110
something alternate here so we can say something like oh image not found.

03:35.300 --> 03:38.780
And we passed that in in quotes as a string that will pop up.

03:38.780 --> 03:46.970
Now if I save that and refreshed my page will say something like oh image not found next to this little

03:46.970 --> 03:48.180
broken icon here.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.910
So that helps us out because later on we're doing more advanced web sites.

03:52.070 --> 03:55.950
I can say something like a little more specific missing.

03:56.030 --> 03:59.030
TNG not found.

03:59.270 --> 04:05.660
So when I'm debugging my web site or checking stuff I immediately know oh missing that PAGG is not found.

04:05.960 --> 04:12.470
But you'll notice if I switch this back to Jingo that PNB which is there and I refresh my website I

04:12.470 --> 04:16.380
don't get that alternate image or alternate text anymore.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.620
It does show up the Django that PMG image and that's really all there is to sourcing an image so you

04:21.620 --> 04:30.410
have the source SIRC and the alternate let me comment that out and refresh this page save this then

04:30.410 --> 04:31.430
refresh my page.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.300
All right.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.060
So we just discussed how to use image tags.

04:35.060 --> 04:40.790
The next thing I want to talk about is an atack which allows us to actually reference in other ASTM

04:40.790 --> 04:48.040
whole file or another Web site to really show this however I will create another aged him file.

04:48.290 --> 04:54.140
So I'm going to bring back my directory and then right click on whatever folder I'm working on this

04:54.140 --> 05:03.030
project folder or I'll add a new file and this new file and going to call it new page h tim L or hit

05:03.170 --> 05:09.830
enter and then this new page that to T.M. I'll start typing T.M. enter so I get all that extra stuff.

05:09.830 --> 05:17.830
And then here the body is going to write a letter or heading one that says this is the new page save

05:17.830 --> 05:18.050
that.

05:18.070 --> 05:22.960
So I have to assume all files basics that studied smell that we've been working with and this new page.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.310
H Tim L has just a single heading in it and if I copy this full page and put it in my browser then I

05:32.310 --> 05:33.850
get this is the new page.

05:33.870 --> 05:34.540
Great.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.750
So what I want to do is try to link this new page or each symbol into my original Basic Set a simple

05:39.750 --> 05:40.600
page.

05:40.650 --> 05:42.060
So let's do that.

05:42.060 --> 05:47.550
I'll come back to basics very simple and to do this I'm going to use in a tag which is just an anchor

05:47.630 --> 05:54.840
Ted and this is going to allow me to pass in a reference there in a ref and I will pass in the reference

05:54.840 --> 06:00.910
to the actual new page or a symbol file that will say new page dot h tim L..

06:01.200 --> 06:06.800
And notice I don't have to pass right now the full directory path where the full file path to this h

06:06.810 --> 06:10.250
tim l file because it's in the same directory as my basic start.

06:10.260 --> 06:15.210
Tim L. If it was a different situation where this was in in other full there somewhere else on my computer

06:15.240 --> 06:18.140
I would have to specify more detail the full file path.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.470
But we'll discuss full file paths and how you should actually create those across different operating

06:22.470 --> 06:23.030
systems.

06:23.130 --> 06:26.910
When we talk about Django right now we'll keep things simple and make sure everything's in the same

06:26.910 --> 06:28.070
directory.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.280
Let me save this so I have my breath in my anchor tag.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.370
But notice this isn't self-closing.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.880
It has its own closing tab which means I can put stuff in between here and this is basically going to

06:39.880 --> 06:47.260
be the text that is a clickable link and that's all an anchor tag so i can say click me.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.210
I will save this refresh.

06:50.500 --> 06:56.140
And now I have this attributes and this click me and I can click on click me and that takes me to the

06:56.140 --> 06:57.400
new page.

06:57.430 --> 07:04.600
So again with this anchor tag we keep a reference here have the text that we want to show when we say

07:05.230 --> 07:07.740
click me and then click on that.

07:07.810 --> 07:08.730
And this is the new page.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.920
That's really all N.A. tag is something to know.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.610
You can reference things that are not just local on your computer.

07:15.610 --> 07:17.390
And that goes for images as well.

07:17.390 --> 07:23.470
So let me show you what I mean by that we can pass in an actual Web site so I'll say something like

07:24.280 --> 07:27.600
HTP that will be there though.

07:28.480 --> 07:34.020
Facebook dot com and make sure you have to put in the full file path of HTP.

07:34.090 --> 07:35.420
Otherwise this won't work.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.320
And now let's change this from click me to something like Facebook.

07:39.430 --> 07:42.140
We'll save that refresh over here.

07:42.190 --> 07:48.400
And now I see Facebook I click on Facebook and that actually takes me to the Facebook Web site and my

07:48.400 --> 07:54.190
browser will actually self-correct this to make sure it's secure so it goes to HTP S..

07:54.520 --> 07:58.350
Cole and for Sless for Slash W.W. that Facebook dot com.

07:58.360 --> 07:58.690
All right.

07:58.690 --> 08:03.610
So that's how you can actually reference web sites that are outside of your project folder.

08:03.640 --> 08:11.200
You can just pasand the full HCC or HTP s file path instead of a local file and you can actually do

08:11.200 --> 08:14.150
the exact same thing for an image tag.

08:14.290 --> 08:19.990
So for example if we see an image here so I see this image of let's say these little triangles going

08:19.990 --> 08:22.380
to open this image in a new tab.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.080
Here we have the entire image path.

08:25.130 --> 08:34.300
So I'm going to actually just copy this image path and then instead of Jingo that PMG I'm going to paste

08:34.300 --> 08:35.950
in that whole image path.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.840
Let's save that and go back to our original web site refresh and we see here.

08:41.860 --> 08:49.360
Now we have that image so I'm allowed to basically pass in an outside image and you can use something

08:49.360 --> 08:54.820
like google image search to actually grab a link to an image and then use that as your source instead

08:54.820 --> 08:56.980
of having to save stuff locally.

08:56.980 --> 09:01.600
Now will be times when you definitely want to save stuff locally in case a link ever breaks online.

09:01.630 --> 09:07.180
That way you make sure you always have a backup or you could just use the source online and then have

09:07.600 --> 09:10.560
maybe an alternate link or an alternate text show up.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.420
All right.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.350
So that's basically it.

09:12.400 --> 09:20.070
As far as attributes than covering images and anchor tags we've learned a ton of material to this point.

09:20.140 --> 09:25.330
So it's really time that we take a step back make sure we've truly understood everything and tackle

09:25.330 --> 09:27.840
an assessment exercise Thanks everyone.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.210
And I'll see you at the next lecture re-explained the assessment.
