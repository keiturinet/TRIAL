Hello everyone and welcome to the team at level 1 assessment.

00:09.190 --> 00:11.550
It's time to practice all your new skills.

00:11.620 --> 00:16.720
You're going to be viewing him Tim file and recreating it based off of what you see in the browser.

00:16.990 --> 00:19.700
The file We're going to be looking at is called H.

00:19.720 --> 00:24.000
Underscore level underscore one underscore assessment HMO.

00:24.070 --> 00:26.500
Let me show you how you should open this in your browser.

00:26.500 --> 00:31.480
That way you don't actually view the H HTML file you just view it in your browser going to jump to Adam

00:31.480 --> 00:33.650
text editor and my browser now.

00:33.970 --> 00:38.190
OK here I am at the Adam text editor and I have my browser open.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.240
Notice here that I'm looking at a new page that I asked him.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.490
You can be looking at any age T.M. file that you created.

00:44.860 --> 00:50.680
And what I've done is I've made sure that I have here in the strictly the h him level one assessment

00:50.770 --> 00:56.870
I asked him l file and you can find that in the course downloads it's under the HMO level one folder.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.080
There's an aged him a on assessment that asked him I'll file there.

01:00.280 --> 01:06.370
What you should do in order to do this exercise is don't click on this but right click and then select

01:06.370 --> 01:11.890
Copy full path and then paste that path into your browser and then hit enter.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.930
And this is what this Web site looks like.

01:13.930 --> 01:15.660
It says Welcome to my Web site.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.840
It says I'm excited to eventually learn Django.

01:17.860 --> 01:22.450
Here's a link to the official jingle Web site and if you click on that link it takes us to the actual

01:22.450 --> 01:26.720
official Gengel Web site which is W.W. that genome project dot com.

01:26.740 --> 01:34.210
Notice it has HTP s there and going back we see we also have a picture of the Python logo and then it

01:34.270 --> 01:39.760
says here are three reasons jingoes cool one is ridiculously fast it's reassuringly secure and it's

01:39.760 --> 01:41.240
exceedingly scalable.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.620
And then there's a bonus optional extra credit.

01:43.870 --> 01:48.750
So what you're going to be doing is in your own HVM file you're going to try to recreate this.

01:48.760 --> 01:55.670
So think of it while you're looking at this HMO site what kind of tag should this have.

01:55.870 --> 01:58.440
And what kind of tag should these three lines have.

01:58.510 --> 02:01.050
And notice one of them is a link to another Web site.

02:01.090 --> 02:06.070
So think about what kind of attribute or tag that specifically should have and then you'll notice that

02:06.070 --> 02:09.270
we also have this picture of the Python logo.

02:09.320 --> 02:15.280
What I want you to do is either download a picture of the Python logo onto your computer and then set

02:15.370 --> 02:21.520
the link locally or it's also good practice is using the image tags we've learned about is to actually

02:21.520 --> 02:27.320
set the source to a image file that's hosted online which is actually what the solutions do.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.670
And then you'll notice here we have a list.

02:29.820 --> 02:30.970
It's a ordered list.

02:30.970 --> 02:36.490
So one two three and there's finally a bonus or optional extra credit which is can you figure out how

02:36.490 --> 02:37.810
to make a picture into a link.

02:37.810 --> 02:42.750
So this first picture Python nothing happens if I click on it but this last one Django.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.340
Notice how it's clickable.

02:44.440 --> 02:50.170
So if I click on that picture it will actually take me to the Django project documentation just like

02:50.410 --> 02:51.570
this top linked it.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.930
So that's extra credit to figure out how to actually make a picture into a link.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.250
We didn't cover that I'll cover that in the solution.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.300
So that's just a bonus.

02:58.300 --> 03:03.210
Again all you're doing is you're copying this file path into your browser and then in this age HTML

03:03.250 --> 03:06.800
file try to manually recreate what's going on here.

03:06.970 --> 03:11.020
And I'm going to be walking through this in the next lecture for the solutions.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.620
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
