Hello everyone and welcome back to the Part 1 h t m l basics lecture.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.290
Let's start off by exploring the very basics of what an H Tim L file looks like and how he can open

00:15.290 --> 00:16.530
it in a browser.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.400
Plus learn about some Adam text editor.

00:19.550 --> 00:23.500
Convenience features to quickly create him files.

00:23.540 --> 00:26.540
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

00:26.540 --> 00:26.830
All right.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.080
Here I am at the Adam text editor as a quick note.

00:30.110 --> 00:35.510
You can either just code along and create new files in the project folders that are provided for you

00:35.810 --> 00:41.210
as a download to the course or you can add your new project folders or new files as you go along.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.500
It's really up to you.

00:42.740 --> 00:49.610
You can always just right click and click a new file new folder or just add a whole new project folder

00:49.610 --> 00:51.520
so you can see a new folder over here.

00:51.530 --> 00:52.790
It's really up to you.

00:52.790 --> 00:58.610
I've already created a project folder called the Tim underscore level underscore one in another quick

00:58.610 --> 00:58.970
note.

00:59.090 --> 01:04.490
Try to avoid using just spaces in your folder names and in your file names you should always try to

01:04.490 --> 01:09.290
replace them with something like an underscore to make sure that you can read the whole file path with

01:09.290 --> 01:10.210
your computer.

01:10.250 --> 01:14.570
Sometimes spaces will mess the computer up in reading the actual file path.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.210
So just a quick note on that.

01:16.550 --> 01:24.590
OK let's start off by creating a new file and we will call it basic stop h Timo and we can do uppercase

01:24.590 --> 01:25.580
or lowercase here.

01:25.580 --> 01:30.050
I'll just keep it simple lowercase because that's usually what they look like.

01:30.050 --> 01:30.740
All right.

01:30.740 --> 01:36.920
So here's a basic slide each T.M. And one thing I want to show you is I can begin to type H T.M..

01:37.040 --> 01:41.740
And you'll notice that Adam text editor has this little pop up that says H him l.

01:41.780 --> 01:47.810
If I hit enter when I see that pop up I will get the basically boilerplate code as it's called or the

01:47.810 --> 01:51.020
skeleton code of and HVM file.

01:51.020 --> 01:55.790
Now let's walk through this and explain what's actually going on in this very first line we see something

01:55.790 --> 02:00.380
that says doc type H Tim L and that's something you are going to find in pretty much all the stem cell

02:00.410 --> 02:01.110
files.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.970
And that basically just tells the browser hey you're looking at an age HTML file.

02:05.010 --> 02:06.680
Then we have the team l tags.

02:06.680 --> 02:12.890
You'll notice we have an opening tag here at the line number two and a closing tag over in line number

02:12.890 --> 02:15.500
10 and difference between the opening and closing tag.

02:15.620 --> 02:20.900
Is it just lets you know when that starts and when it stops and the closing will notice has a little

02:20.900 --> 02:22.260
forward slash in it.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.840
And what's nice about Adam text editor is you'll see these little arrows pop up which just allow you

02:26.850 --> 02:33.560
to collapse or open things between their opening and closing tags so that's just for organization.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.200
Then we have two major sections.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.810
The head of the team M-file and the body of the team are File.

02:40.070 --> 02:45.500
Let's start off by just explaining what the head is the head of the HMO which is this first section

02:45.800 --> 02:51.710
is going to contain the meta data and for this first section of the course the H team at level 1 we

02:51.710 --> 02:56.570
won't be doing a whole lot with the actual head of the L that will come into play a lot more than we

02:56.570 --> 03:04.160
actually UCSF in javascript but it's going to mainly serve as how to link your HMO document to other

03:04.160 --> 03:09.960
types of files such as your CSSA file or your database javascript's file but another tag that we noticed

03:09.960 --> 03:11.280
it's NHT male head.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.720
Is this title tag.

03:12.950 --> 03:19.190
And that's basically what's going to show up as the title when you open this up in a browser and the

03:19.190 --> 03:21.260
title is just what's shown in the tab.

03:21.470 --> 03:29.970
So I'm going to type in in-between this title tag something like this is the title exclamation mark.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.600
And notice I don't need any quotes here.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.430
It's just pure text in between these tags.

03:34.450 --> 03:41.330
And h tim l will recognize it and then this other meta data is just telling you what character set you

03:41.350 --> 03:43.860
would expect and that's UTF 8 encoding.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.220
Don't worry about that too much right now.

03:46.220 --> 03:51.910
Then finally we have the body and the body is going to contain the actual content.

03:53.110 --> 03:58.010
We're going to be discussing actual content such as paragraphs and lists etc. throughout this section

03:58.000 --> 03:58.830
of the course.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.140
Right now we'll leave the body blank.

04:01.360 --> 04:07.510
Last thing I want to show you before we actually view the safe's female file in our browser is how to

04:07.510 --> 04:08.730
comment code.

04:09.030 --> 04:12.380
So and ASTM l comments look like this.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.280
You do a opening tag.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.840
Exclamation mark dash dash.

04:18.250 --> 04:24.360
And that says that's the start of the comment and then the end of the comment is dash dash.

04:24.370 --> 04:30.400
The other closing sign and then anything here is a comment.

04:30.540 --> 04:35.730
The other quick way to do this is if you have some text or a line of code you can just do a control

04:35.760 --> 04:37.870
or command depending on your OS.

04:38.070 --> 04:44.570
A forward slash in Adam and sublime text editor will actually just auto comment everything there.

04:44.730 --> 04:51.390
Or if you wanted to you can actually highlight many lines and then do control forward slash to comment

04:51.480 --> 04:54.340
or control forward slash to uncomment.

04:54.360 --> 04:54.930
All right.

04:55.140 --> 04:59.880
So anything in between those two types of tags is a comment and it's just control or command forward

04:59.880 --> 05:07.560
slash to quickly make a line or multiple lines in actual comments and when you do control s here to

05:07.560 --> 05:10.520
save this then let's open this up in a browser.

05:10.590 --> 05:17.010
So the way we open this up in our browser is by just passing in the entire file path into the browser.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.070
For now we're going to be just running things locally.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.790
So that's how it will work.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.950
I'm going to right click on MH T.M. file and then say copy full path.

05:25.950 --> 05:30.370
So it will copy the full path to that and then let me bring in a browser window.

05:32.650 --> 05:37.940
And here is a browser window and what I can do is right where my browser usually goes.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.520
I'm going to just copy and paste that file path.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.980
So this is just the whole file path to that actual HTL file.

05:44.140 --> 05:49.480
I hit enter and I noticed something that's just basically a blank page and that makes sense we haven't

05:49.480 --> 05:55.540
provided any content or each content in the body of each team I'll file but what we do notice is this

05:55.920 --> 06:00.450
our little this is the title in the title actually showed up.

06:00.550 --> 06:01.560
Perfect.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.270
So that's really all there is for the very basics of an AFEs Himmel file.

06:05.470 --> 06:11.140
What NH him I'll file mostly will be as we work with it or the actual body tags.

06:11.260 --> 06:18.250
So let's go ahead and continue on by editing this file with body tags in part 2 in the next lecture.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.170
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
