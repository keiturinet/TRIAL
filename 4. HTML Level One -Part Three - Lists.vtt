Hello everyone and welcome to part three of a small level one where we discuss how to create a list

00:10.540 --> 00:11.800
an HMO.

00:12.270 --> 00:15.810
A lot of times you want to get your information on your e-mail page organized.

00:15.820 --> 00:20.450
And one way to do this is with a list an e-mail has two main types of lists.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.140
That's an ordered list and an unordered list and we can actually then add list elements to each of these

00:26.140 --> 00:26.880
types.

00:27.070 --> 00:30.940
Let's get started by jumping to the Adam text editor and our browser.

00:30.940 --> 00:36.490
All right here I am with my Adam text editor open and I have right now just the simple basics that DML

00:36.580 --> 00:41.620
documents we've been working with and I've deleted everything beleft one heading one that says lists

00:41.710 --> 00:42.640
on it.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.360
Let me first show you how to create an ordered list.

00:45.550 --> 00:52.050
Now an ordered list is numbered so you can see number one the first item number to the second item etc..

00:52.120 --> 00:57.870
So to start off with an ordered list you just type o l and then you can click enter here.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.670
And Adam text editor will automatically create the opening tag and closing tag for you and then inside

01:03.670 --> 01:06.630
of this ordered list you're going to have list elements.

01:06.670 --> 01:11.150
If I save this and then refresh my page you notice nothing's actually changed.

01:11.230 --> 01:16.540
So I do have an ordered list there but with no elements in it to create a list item or list element

01:16.630 --> 01:21.010
it's just as I said be your tag and then whatever you want in there.

01:21.010 --> 01:26.940
So in this case we'll just say first item going to save that and refreshed this.

01:26.950 --> 01:31.340
And I see now I have my one first item and let me zoom in here a little bit.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.010
We're going to do control plus to zoom in on the safest Tim else we can see it a little better here.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.330
So here's my first item.

01:38.560 --> 01:46.600
And as I continue to add list elements into this order list such as my second item save this and refresh

01:46.600 --> 01:52.500
the page you can see here that they are numbered and this will continue on as long as I just keep Eida

01:52.750 --> 01:59.350
adding items into this actual list so third item there refresh and here we can see the numbering.

01:59.350 --> 02:05.040
Now later on of CSSA you can actually change the numbers if you want to use something like roman numerals.

02:05.260 --> 02:09.700
But this is a very basic default of an HMO ordered list.

02:09.700 --> 02:14.860
Now a lot of times you actually don't want to number things you just want some sort of bullet point.

02:14.860 --> 02:20.080
And if you want that then what you're looking for isn't an ordered list and to create an unordered list.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.010
You use the tag UL for an ordered list.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.230
So you all enter there.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.540
It creates the opening and closing tags for me.

02:27.750 --> 02:32.590
And now as the add list items all say bulat one here.

02:33.540 --> 02:36.690
Add another item here will say second item.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.790
You can really add whatever text you want here.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.440
Well do ally enter here and then we'll say third item going to save this and refresh and I you see I

02:46.440 --> 02:50.910
have an unordered list where there is no number but everything is just a bullet point.

02:50.910 --> 02:55.190
And that's the main difference between an ordered list o l and an unordered list.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.470
UL and the last thing I want to cover quickly here is a nested list.

02:59.490 --> 03:04.800
So you can actually nest lists inside of each other and you can test an ordered list inside of an unordered

03:04.800 --> 03:06.810
list or vice versa.

03:06.810 --> 03:12.590
Let me show you an example of this and I'll show you kind of an extreme example of nesting lists.

03:12.630 --> 03:16.980
So you usually won't see that many list and into each other but I just want to show you this.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.250
You can get an idea of what's possible.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.590
So here's an ordered list and I'm going to have two items in it.

03:22.590 --> 03:32.450
First item one and then item 2 and I'm just using the autocomplete there enter to make that a little

03:32.450 --> 03:32.840
quicker.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.790
So here's item one here's item too.

03:34.970 --> 03:38.070
And they're numbered because they're inside an ordered list.

03:38.330 --> 03:46.010
And now I'm going to put in an ordered list inside of these ordered list tags I put in that an ordered

03:46.010 --> 03:52.700
list which means if I add some new list elements will be inside so I'm going to say something like I'm

03:53.090 --> 03:56.160
nested inside for that list item.

03:56.390 --> 04:03.350
And you know make another list item that says also nested exclamation mark will save that refresh this

04:03.470 --> 04:05.810
and we can see here that was that nesting.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.970
We also get an extra in the notation.

04:08.090 --> 04:14.750
So a symbol can show that this is nested inside of this list so if we wanted to get say Item one item

04:14.750 --> 04:18.560
two and then we could say these are like sub items of item 2.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.170
That is an unordered list.

04:21.170 --> 04:26.210
Now we can actually keep going if this if you wanted something further nested then we could put an ordered

04:26.210 --> 04:36.590
list in there and then say something like whoa I'm really nice that exclamation mark and let's emphasize

04:36.590 --> 04:39.180
this by putting some of this in bold.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.790
So remember we have these strong tags to put something in bold.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.470
And I'm going to go in there.

04:48.010 --> 04:48.400
We go.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.080
Now let's save that.

04:50.270 --> 04:52.580
Refresh this and we can see here.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.240
Item one.

04:53.270 --> 04:57.800
Item 2 we have this nested unordered list and then whoa I'm really nested there.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.970
So it's just a very quick example of nesting lists.

05:00.990 --> 05:05.660
We're not going to do it too often in the course but I just want you to be aware of the ability to do

05:05.660 --> 05:06.310
that.

05:06.360 --> 05:06.970
All right.

05:07.010 --> 05:09.920
So that's really all there is for lists themselves.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.890
It's a pretty basic topic remember you essentially have this oh well for ordered list and you fell for

05:15.980 --> 05:21.560
an ordered list and then inside of either these every item in that list is going to have an L.A. tag

05:21.920 --> 05:23.360
Corri list elements.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.150
OK thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.
