00:05.220 --> 00:07.930
Hello everyone and welcome back to part two.

00:08.010 --> 00:14.210
The basic tagging lecture in this lecture we're going to go over some basic heading and paragraph tags

00:14.540 --> 00:19.390
and tags are basically a way to allow you to insert elements into an age HTML file.

00:19.490 --> 00:23.600
And we're also going to be showing you a few resources to use as a reference as you continue learning

00:23.640 --> 00:24.670
about Timo.

00:25.070 --> 00:30.410
Let's go ahead and get started by opening our Adam text editor and a browser.

00:30.410 --> 00:31.840
I'll see you there.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.150
All right.

00:32.150 --> 00:38.480
Here I have a split screen between the Adam and text editor and my browser and this is actually a view

00:38.480 --> 00:44.000
we're going to be using a lot in the course because we'd like to see changes and not have to jump back

00:44.000 --> 00:46.780
and forth between the browser and the text editor.

00:46.820 --> 00:49.400
So a lot of times it seems you just have a split screen like this.

00:49.530 --> 00:55.120
So I can just refresh the page in the browser when I'm actually doing edits in the Adam text editor.

00:55.130 --> 01:00.070
But before we get started I'm continuing working with this basic study him L5 from The Last Lecture.

01:00.070 --> 01:05.240
I don't want to discuss our two resources online that you're going to be running into a lot as you do

01:05.240 --> 01:09.700
some Google searches for terms in case you ever need to reference some sort of resource.

01:09.770 --> 01:14.170
And those two resources are something called W3 schools dot com.

01:14.300 --> 01:18.470
And the other one is the developer that Mozilla the org Web site.

01:18.500 --> 01:24.590
And here I have just searched for h tim l element tags on Google in Lotus at the very first hit is this

01:24.590 --> 01:26.320
W3 schools dot com.

01:26.480 --> 01:32.720
And usually when you ask Google for some basic question on H Tim L or C Ss a lot of times the very first

01:32.720 --> 01:39.080
link that pops up is it W3 schools dot com and these three schools dot com is basically just a very

01:39.080 --> 01:45.270
large reference site for a front end web development like a Tim elsea SS and Javascript.

01:45.620 --> 01:50.270
And you notice that as you go through the Web site it'll basically just give you a bunch of resources

01:50.270 --> 01:54.030
and references for a lot of the stuff are going to be talking about this course.

01:54.050 --> 01:58.350
So if you ever Google stuff and you find yourself on this Web site feel free to check it out.

01:58.430 --> 02:04.790
Now it's an OK Web site mainly the main reason you see it as the top hit is just because it's been around

02:04.790 --> 02:10.400
so long that I would actually suggest that when you're Google searching and you come up with a reference

02:10.400 --> 02:15.250
to this developer that Mozilla or excite you actually choose this site instead.

02:15.380 --> 02:16.250
It's a little better.

02:16.250 --> 02:21.650
It has more detail and it's really geared towards developers so if you click on this developer that

02:21.650 --> 02:27.770
Mozilla org link it has an H Tim L element reference and this is basically a reference to all the HTML

02:27.830 --> 02:33.560
elements and HTML elements are just going to allow us to actually insert material into our ASML text

02:33.560 --> 02:34.130
file.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.170
And you see here that it's a little more technical and it's a little more geared towards developers.

02:39.170 --> 02:45.320
While the W3 schools dot com website is geared more towards basic beginners and as you advance through

02:45.320 --> 02:50.540
this course you're probably going to find this developer that Mozilla or excite more useful to you.

02:50.540 --> 02:55.640
So I just want to let you know that these are two resources you're going to be coming through in contact

02:55.640 --> 02:58.840
with a lot as you do some Google searching on your own.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.740
Ok now that we've covered that.

03:00.740 --> 03:06.210
Let's jump back to this browser tab where we have the basic study T.M. file.

03:06.210 --> 03:12.710
We've been working with last time open up here and I'm going to go ahead and open it up here and to

03:12.710 --> 03:18.230
get a little more room on my screen I'm actually going to close or collapse this left tab here and I

03:18.230 --> 03:23.510
can do that just by doing either control backslash or command the backslash on your keyboard.

03:23.660 --> 03:27.140
And that just opens and collapses that little sayto.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.130
So a really useful shortcut for the Adam text editor.

03:31.790 --> 03:36.850
Now the first time we're going to be learning about are the header tags or a heading tag.

03:37.190 --> 03:39.800
And let's show you how to do that to start off.

03:39.860 --> 03:51.710
We'll do a heading 1 Ted or or one tag and basically we just have H-1 open and then H-1 close.

03:53.440 --> 03:59.660
And then anything in between this any text is going to be a header Hetter So the say this is a roll

03:59.740 --> 04:04.500
call on heading 1 and then I'm going to save this.

04:04.510 --> 04:08.830
So just either control or command this next to that say then I'm going to refresh this.

04:08.830 --> 04:15.010
And we see now on our Web page we see this is a heading 1 and basically a heading produces a larger

04:15.010 --> 04:16.590
font that is bold.

04:16.750 --> 04:21.790
And we're going to learn a lot more about how to actually dictate textiles such as font size whether

04:21.790 --> 04:23.520
something is bold or italic.

04:23.590 --> 04:28.510
Later on in the course we'll cover a little bit about and italics and this lecture but later on we'll

04:28.510 --> 04:31.870
actually talk about more styling where the actual font.

04:31.930 --> 04:36.790
Now we can just explore the very basics of age T.M. and what your browser does by default.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.660
If heading one is too big for you while you can actually have heading to.

04:40.790 --> 04:45.610
And you'll notice that Adam text editor actually provides us with these autocomplete options so you

04:45.610 --> 04:50.740
can just go down here on your keyboard then hit enter on one of these and you'll notice we automatically

04:50.740 --> 04:55.120
get the opening and closing tags so you'll find yourself using that a lot as you continue on through

04:55.120 --> 04:57.060
this course and will type something like.

04:57.070 --> 05:04.510
This is a heading to save that and then refresh our page here and we see if we get a same heading so

05:04.510 --> 05:09.690
it's in bold but it's a little smaller and there's actually a heading three so we can do that it was

05:09.700 --> 05:16.610
well we'll call this heading 3 save this refresh and we noticed we get an even smaller heading etc..

05:16.810 --> 05:23.940
And this actually goes all the way down to heading 6 which is going to be the smallest heading possible

05:25.000 --> 05:29.360
so notice that it's actually still in bold but it's very small.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.360
If you use one.

05:30.370 --> 05:35.080
Essentially what is a normal text size you can use what is known as a paragraph.

05:35.410 --> 05:38.500
And that's just a Pete suddenly right.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.790
This is a paragraph

05:44.980 --> 05:45.980
what G.

05:46.150 --> 05:48.560
Save this and then refresh.

05:48.970 --> 05:52.150
And you if we get this is a paragraph which is just here normal text.

05:52.150 --> 05:55.760
It's not in bold and we're ready to go there.

05:55.940 --> 06:03.640
But something to know is that each of these lines with the new tags is basically in its own block and

06:04.030 --> 06:10.330
headings are there own block as well as paragraphs so paragraph tax tags can actually create separation

06:10.650 --> 06:12.000
and let me show you what I mean by that.

06:12.280 --> 06:19.750
If I overhear in my mail file try to write on multiple lines so I say this is a paragraph.

06:19.870 --> 06:26.070
This is line two then this is line three.

06:26.260 --> 06:32.620
If I save this and then refresh this notice that I don't actually get that effect that I was looking

06:32.620 --> 06:36.070
for in my team I'll file when it gets displayed in my browser.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.940
It all goes into one continuous line.

06:38.980 --> 06:45.970
If I actually want separate blocks I need to separate them into actual different tags which means I

06:45.970 --> 06:49.790
would need to have each of these separate lines in its own paragraph tag.

06:49.870 --> 06:57.520
So it had to have this be this is line to and then this one be line three.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.460
So this is line three right here.

07:00.430 --> 07:06.640
And paste it in and then grab this close antagonist's ticket back to the original right there.

07:06.640 --> 07:12.220
Now let's save this and if we refresh this we can see that now they're all in their separate blocks

07:12.640 --> 07:17.420
and something to note here is that your age T.M. file doesn't really care about indentation.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.830
What it really cares about are just these tags.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.940
That's what's really going to define how lines are built and how blocks are separated.

07:25.030 --> 07:29.340
So I can actually put multiple paragraph tags on the same line here.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.100
So we'll do this.

07:30.100 --> 07:34.620
Put them all on line 14 just to show you what I mean.

07:34.630 --> 07:39.140
So here you have all those three paragraph tags on the same line they're on line 14.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.410
If I saved this again and refresh I get the exact same effect.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.550
So it's really the tags that are telling.

07:45.690 --> 07:48.200
H Tim L What is in the same block.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.450
Not the actual line number or the indentation.

07:52.450 --> 07:58.270
In other programming languages you'll use brackets Oren's Python you a lot of times use indentation

07:58.510 --> 08:01.500
to clarify which blocks goes where NHT melts.

08:01.510 --> 08:03.650
Basically all done by tags.

08:03.790 --> 08:07.040
And you notice I can keep writing on separate lines here.

08:07.060 --> 08:09.760
So whoops delete that.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.380
Say something like this is continued.

08:15.670 --> 08:24.520
I'm still writing in line to save this and if I refresh this you notice that since that's all contained

08:24.550 --> 08:27.950
in the second paragraph it all goes here.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.580
All right.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.730
So that's the very basics of what a heading tag is and what a paragraph tag is.

08:34.840 --> 08:40.540
Thinks there is that headings can go from 1 to 6 or 8 1 to 8 8 6.

08:40.610 --> 08:43.910
And what makes them a little different is their size and the fact that they're in bold.

08:44.150 --> 08:49.460
And then we have for normal text paragraph tags and something though the really useful is a lot of times

08:49.490 --> 08:56.630
you need filler text and Adam text editor and Sublime Text Editor have for you is the lore ipsum statement

08:56.630 --> 09:01.330
which is basically just a bunch of filler Latin text and if you start typing.

09:01.370 --> 09:04.750
Laura I notice you get this little pop up here.

09:04.790 --> 09:11.550
Go ahead and just select that and enter and you'll get a bunch of code or text here I should say.

09:11.660 --> 09:16.400
And it's basically just a bunch of filler text that's really common to use in web development.

09:16.430 --> 09:22.040
In case you just need some filler text so if I save this and refresh this page notice now I get wups

09:22.300 --> 09:26.750
that tells me if I want to translate it no because it's in Latin but you just get a bunch of filler

09:26.750 --> 09:27.950
text here in Latin.

09:27.950 --> 09:33.050
So this is really common to use as you need filler code for your web development and you can do it just

09:33.050 --> 09:39.420
by typing in Lorem and then hitting enter in either sublime text editor or an Adam text editor.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.880
It works in both.

09:40.910 --> 09:42.570
All right saving that there.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.420
Well let's refresh this.

09:44.420 --> 09:49.970
And I remove that glass thing I want to cover is bold and italics.

09:49.970 --> 09:57.260
Now there is actually an old way of showing bold and italics in HVM L and there's a newer syntax for

09:57.260 --> 09:57.660
it.

09:57.710 --> 10:01.200
Let me show you the old way first and then I'll show you the new way.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.870
So let me delete these paragraphs.

10:04.790 --> 10:06.800
And just type in something very simple will say.

10:06.800 --> 10:18.540
This is text that is in bold and then below it will say this is text that is in it x

10:21.350 --> 10:21.810
x.

10:21.850 --> 10:29.180
Ok so if I actually want to make this bold the old way would be to do it with a B call.

10:29.380 --> 10:36.010
So what I would end up doing is wrapping this whole thing or whatever I want it to be bold in B.

10:36.310 --> 10:38.200
So it would look like this.

10:38.200 --> 10:44.620
So we call our closing tag be here and if you just type in B Adam text editor will also give you the

10:44.620 --> 10:50.350
autocomplete for the bold go to save this and then refresh and notice here series says.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.710
Now this is text that is in bold.

10:52.750 --> 10:59.620
So this is the old way of doing bold text and the old way of doing a taluk text is with an eye call

10:59.920 --> 11:01.360
or an eye tag.

11:01.390 --> 11:10.480
So notice here we see eye for a taluk which means if I wrap this whole thing and open and close i tags

11:11.940 --> 11:14.300
and save this and refresh it.

11:14.310 --> 11:19.620
Now that this text is in a taluk here so we can see that this is text that is in bold and this text

11:19.980 --> 11:22.870
is in a taluk So that was the old way of doing things.

11:22.890 --> 11:29.070
There's a newer semantic way because B and I aren't very clear on exactly what they're doing.

11:29.070 --> 11:33.390
These are just two letters and you always want to be really clear when you're coding especially if you're

11:33.390 --> 11:35.120
going to come look at this code in the future.

11:35.280 --> 11:40.540
So the newer semantic way of doing stuff is if you want text to be bold.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.600
The new keyword for that is a strong tag.

11:44.650 --> 11:49.750
So this works and it basically exactly the same way as the bold tag except now it just says strong.

11:49.900 --> 11:53.890
So that might be a little clearer when you come back to your code that you know that it's going to be

11:53.890 --> 11:54.300
in bold.

11:54.300 --> 11:58.470
We see here there's no changes or refresh because that's just a new syntax.

11:58.480 --> 12:05.530
And now for the Tallackson you syntax is E-M for emphasis or emphasized.

12:05.660 --> 12:11.950
So if you want to add emphasis to text you would italicize it or with the new tagging syntax it's E-M

12:11.950 --> 12:15.260
for emphasis so save this refresh.

12:15.490 --> 12:19.810
And we see here there's no change because that still works exactly the same way.

12:19.810 --> 12:25.840
So again the old way is with the B and I tags the newer way which is the way I would suggest doing it

12:25.870 --> 12:30.630
as you go throughout this course is the strong tag and the E-M for emphasis tag.

12:30.820 --> 12:31.810
All right.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.590
That's really all there is to this lecture.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.880
Hopefully you found it pretty straightforward.

12:36.040 --> 12:41.170
Again you may want to play around with different headers adding more paragraphs etc. but everything

12:41.170 --> 12:41.980
should have been straightforward.

12:41.980 --> 12:48.640
Right now all we've covered is just a few basic tags such as heading tags paragraph tags and bulled

12:48.880 --> 12:50.230
and Atomics.

12:50.310 --> 12:53.160
OK thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.
