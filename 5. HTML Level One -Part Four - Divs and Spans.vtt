Hello everyone and welcome to part 4 divs and spans.

00:10.350 --> 00:15.110
So in this lecture we're going to be showing you some examples of how to use a div and Hispan tag.

00:15.330 --> 00:20.630
However keep in mind that we actually won't really be able to utilize them until we learn about CSSA.

00:20.910 --> 00:27.180
Basically we're going to be using DIVX and spand tax to actually group together blocks of H Tim L.

00:27.330 --> 00:31.410
And the reason we want to group them together usually is to apply CSSA to them.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.470
So keep that in mind as we learn about them in this lecture.

00:34.470 --> 00:40.380
They probably won't seem to take any effect into account but later on we will see how they are useful

00:40.470 --> 00:42.930
when adding in style of success.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.450
Let's jump to the Adam text editor just to show you how they work.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.030
OK so here I am at the Adam text editor and I also have my browser open and a little zoomed in here

00:51.030 --> 00:53.220
so you can see the text clearly.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.870
Right now I just have a heading one here.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.860
Let me go in and show you what it would look like if you were to use a DIV tag and this basically stands

01:01.860 --> 01:09.300
for division and then allows you to tag together groups of elements into basically generic containers.

01:09.300 --> 01:16.620
So for instance let's say I have another heading 1 and this is something that says we'll call it group

01:16.630 --> 01:28.490
1 and then I have a paragraph here that says I want to be together in group 1.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.130
So let me say that refreshed this.

01:31.130 --> 01:36.140
And we see we have different span's group 1 and then the paragraph says I want to be together in group

01:36.140 --> 01:36.900
1.

01:37.070 --> 01:44.220
Later on when we learn about CSSA what we want to do is add styles to particular elements in our T.M.

01:44.750 --> 01:49.370
and what we can do that is actually saying okay apply style number one.

01:49.370 --> 01:54.180
So for instance the color red to all heading 1 tags.

01:54.260 --> 01:57.030
So that would just go along and say Hayes is heading 110.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.100
OK this font colors now red.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.130
It's is heading 110.

02:00.140 --> 02:02.570
OK this font color is now red.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.440
But sometimes you actually don't want to do it by the actual element type.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.520
You want to do it by specific division or a group of elements that you define.

02:10.630 --> 02:16.120
And the way you can do that as we'll see later on the CSSA section is actually calling a DIV tag.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.660
And so the way with the work is you can see here I have div..

02:19.680 --> 02:21.140
Now if I hit enter.

02:21.230 --> 02:27.920
Notice that we automatically get this class to pop out here and that's going to allow us to essentially

02:27.920 --> 02:35.150
name this division after a class and then we can apply styles to that class and we can put whatever

02:35.150 --> 02:36.720
you want in that class.

02:36.720 --> 02:44.030
So for instance I cannot put this all here give this class a name such as something like group 1.

02:44.120 --> 02:44.890
Save this.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.390
And if I refresh us we won't notice anything different.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.440
Here in D.H. Tim L..

02:49.550 --> 02:56.600
Later on when we learn about C Ss we'll learn how to actually add style to a division with a class name

02:56.840 --> 02:59.450
instead of just actual element tags.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.720
And that's basically what we're going to be using a division for.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.450
So right now there's still time by itself and each T.M. doesn't mean a whole lot it's going to mean

03:07.460 --> 03:12.920
a lot more we learn about C Ss So if this was a little unclear to you especially if that class keyword

03:13.190 --> 03:16.630
don't worry about it too much it's going to make a lot more sense in the future.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.130
I just want to introduce it now because it really is just a Tamil.

03:20.160 --> 03:27.200
It's not C Ss it's used in combination of C Ss OK and then the last thing I want to mention here is

03:27.200 --> 03:33.880
the span tag and basically the spand tag is almost the exact same thing as a division except it's inline

03:34.070 --> 03:36.790
instead of grabbing an entire container.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.650
So let's say we have this class or this div division of group 1.

03:41.690 --> 03:47.870
If I wanted to make essentially a little inline container to only apply effects to an inline section

03:47.900 --> 03:54.230
so only apply effects for instance to these three letters or three words here be together in what I

03:54.230 --> 04:01.430
could do is wrap them in a span tag and then put whatever I want there to be in that span.

04:01.430 --> 04:05.780
And again I want to say this and refresh this here we don't notice any difference because we haven't

04:05.780 --> 04:07.720
actually applied any style to it.

04:07.820 --> 04:13.660
But just keep these two words in mind for tagging when we later learned about C Ss.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.610
OK so again not a whole lot to actually show here.

04:17.660 --> 04:22.790
Basics of this lecture's just to be aware that there is a DIV tag and a span tag.

04:22.940 --> 04:27.010
If their usefulness doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you right now don't worry about it.

04:27.080 --> 04:31.870
It will make a lot more sense when we actually read or reach the CSA section of the course.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.340
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
