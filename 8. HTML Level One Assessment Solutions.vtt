00:05.400 --> 00:11.560
Hello everyone and welcome back to the assessment's solutions lecture for the aged female level 1 Section.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.470
Let's get right to it by hopping to Adam text editor in our browser.

00:15.570 --> 00:15.890
OK.

00:15.900 --> 00:19.740
Here you have the Adam text editor and my browser and I have two files open.

00:19.740 --> 00:22.050
One is the actual exercise file.

00:22.050 --> 00:28.530
This time I live one assessment and I have this basic study cell file open here and another tab and

00:28.530 --> 00:33.570
that's what I'm going to be editing to try to match what the exercise file looks like.

00:33.570 --> 00:35.060
So let's take it step by step.

00:35.070 --> 00:41.070
The first thing I notice here in the exercise file is that my tab says exercise title and that's a little

00:41.070 --> 00:43.970
hint that we have to actually put in a title here.

00:44.120 --> 00:51.180
So let's match that up we'll say exercise title say and then refreshing this.

00:51.180 --> 00:57.450
Now I see exercise title and it matches the exercise and then we can continue on with the rest of the

00:57.450 --> 00:58.880
body of the h tim L..

00:59.130 --> 01:04.110
And here we have welcome to my Web site and hopefully you're able to recognize that that's a Heading

01:04.110 --> 01:04.720
1.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.530
So I'll say welcome to my Web site there.

01:09.860 --> 01:15.330
And then we have a paragraph that says I'm excited to eventually learn Django.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.000
So let's add that in.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.350
I'm excited too.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.970
We'll just say learn Django.

01:21.570 --> 01:22.810
And let's add a couple more lines.

01:22.810 --> 01:28.580
The body isn't going to collapse the directory tree so you get a little more room here to see great.

01:29.140 --> 01:34.750
And then here is a little bit trickier it says here is the link to the official Django Web site and

01:34.750 --> 01:39.550
hopefully remember from the attributes lecture that I can use an anchor tag to actually put in a link

01:39.900 --> 01:44.580
and an anchor that just looks like an A but it's not a Capital Agency lowercase.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.850
And and we need to add or ref.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.480
So that's going to be a link to the official Web site.

01:49.570 --> 01:50.840
So let me put that in.

01:50.860 --> 02:01.750
That's going to be TTP s colon CT slash for Slash Stubley though w that Jingo project dot com.

02:01.740 --> 02:06.410
And if you need a reference for that all you have to do was click on that link and then mark down the

02:06.410 --> 02:07.040
URL.

02:07.370 --> 02:12.980
And then I want to add in the actual text and I can do this on multiple lines instead of just one single

02:12.980 --> 02:13.550
long line.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.560
It's really up to you.

02:14.960 --> 02:28.240
But we'll say here is a link to the official jingo website I'm going to save that and then refresh my

02:28.240 --> 02:29.750
basic studies T.M..

02:29.890 --> 02:31.390
And so far it's looking pretty good.

02:31.390 --> 02:36.580
The reason it's larger right now is because I'm more zoomed in and that's just for clarity.

02:36.700 --> 02:41.180
So I could zoom in here and see more detail.

02:41.180 --> 02:44.160
That way it's a little easier for you the student to view my screen.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.210
So that's all the difference in the actual sizing but the actual elements themselves are still the same.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.660
And then we have another paragraphed says here's a picture of the Python logo.

02:52.730 --> 02:53.670
Let's add that in.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.690
Now we can tell another paragraph because it's starting on a new line or a new block.

02:58.700 --> 03:05.130
So I'll say here is a pic of the Python logo.

03:07.430 --> 03:09.490
And then I want to add in a picture here.

03:09.570 --> 03:12.890
And remember to add in a picture or an image we use an image tag.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.750
And that's just going to be I am g.

03:15.950 --> 03:19.660
And here's our image tag and what we need is a source for this image tag.

03:19.670 --> 03:22.900
Now what you can do is just use Google images to find that source.

03:23.150 --> 03:28.850
So it will open up a new tab to google images and search for Python alone which looks something like

03:28.850 --> 03:29.410
this.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.980
And I can select any of these.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.610
And I just click on this.

03:32.690 --> 03:42.180
I click on view image and then just copy and paste this into my source so let me save that and refresh

03:42.180 --> 03:42.930
this.

03:42.930 --> 03:47.600
And here is the picture of the Python logo looks like everything's matching correctly.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.320
Now let's come back here and continue on with the rest of the body.

03:51.360 --> 04:00.750
So I have my image set up and now I have another paragraph that says Here are three reasons Django is

04:00.750 --> 04:01.270
cool.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.800
And notice here we have an ordered list.

04:05.830 --> 04:12.060
Remember for an ordered list we just type o l and then each element in the list is an ally or list element.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.100
And I'm just going to paraphrase here.

04:14.110 --> 04:17.830
I'll say it's because it's fast secure.

04:18.790 --> 04:25.850
And the last one will be scalable and I'm saving a lot of time just by using the auto completion of

04:25.980 --> 04:27.130
Adam text editor.

04:27.400 --> 04:35.060
So let's save that refresh our basic's page and here we can see the order list is now included.

04:35.230 --> 04:40.890
And then finally the bonus optional extra credit was can you figure out how to make a picture a link

04:41.170 --> 04:45.390
and basically what we have to do is combine an anchor tag with an image tag.

04:45.520 --> 04:52.750
So usually with the anchor tags we had in ref to the actual Web site link and then we had some text

04:52.860 --> 04:56.360
or we're going to do is instead of text here put in an image tag.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.400
And hopefully we're able to figure it out if you weren't able to.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.500
It's not a big deal.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.160
You will learn now.

05:02.410 --> 05:09.120
I'll put in the anchor Ted and the Tref I want is again to the actual jingle project web site so I can

05:09.120 --> 05:11.370
just copy and paste this from that first link.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.840
There we go.

05:13.850 --> 05:20.720
And then inside of the sinker attached instead of text I want to put in an actual image tag soul say

05:20.750 --> 05:21.680
I am g.

05:21.940 --> 05:28.190
There is my image and the source is going to be this jingoes so I'll just come back to Google images

05:28.250 --> 05:31.840
and search here or Django logo.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.540
And here's a jingle logo doesn't really matter which one you use.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.560
Click on either one of them.

05:37.560 --> 05:43.340
Click View image and then copy this and paste it in as the source.

05:43.650 --> 05:50.600
Save this let's reload our basic site is simple and here you have a very large image but that's OK.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.630
Later on we'll learn how to resize images but if I click on that image.

05:53.640 --> 05:59.260
Important part is it takes me to H.T. to piastre that Ching jingle project dot com.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.470
And that's basically all you had to do.

06:01.470 --> 06:06.780
Hopefully you felt comfortable enough that you could recognize what type of elements were in a web site

06:07.140 --> 06:09.910
and duplicate them in your own H-2 him file.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.520
That's really the point of this exercise.

06:11.670 --> 06:18.030
Being able to look at a Web site a very basic web site and say oh I know what I can do in NHT mail to

06:18.030 --> 06:19.980
reproduce that.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.350
All right.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.400
That's it for HDMI level 1.

06:22.580 --> 06:27.200
It should have been pretty straightforward and pretty basic as far as everything we've covered.

06:27.200 --> 06:32.720
Coming up next in the sections is HMO level 2 we're going to learn even more about each T.M. so we can

06:32.720 --> 06:36.910
know enough to lead into CSSA which will allow us to sense the child each time.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section of the course.
